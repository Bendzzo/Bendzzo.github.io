                <p>A network is a set of computers and devices connected so they can communicate and share resources. Networks can be classified according to various criteria.

According to the <strong>21...........</strong> we divide them into a client-server or peer-to-peer network. According to the <strong>22...........</strong> we divide them into 4 types: A/an <strong>23...........</strong> network is a type of network where all computers are connected to a main cable. In a/an <strong>24...........</strong> network, all data flows through a central hub, a common connection point for the devices in the network. In a/an <strong>25...........</strong> network all devices are connected to one another in a continuous loop. In a/an <strong>26...........</strong> network each PC is linked to several others which has an advantage of when one connection breaks, the data can use other connections.

E-government can be classified into E-services which include digital <strong>33...........</strong> (provide) of services by governments and into E-collaboration which means digital communications in public activities like voting or paying tax. The e-government has a wide range of objectives including better <strong>34...........</strong> (deliver) of public services to people, enhancing business and industry collaborations and citizen <strong>35...........</strong> (empower) through better access to information. The resulting advantages can be less corruption, higher transparency, and higher comfort, development in income and also reduction in costs e.g. paper <strong>36...........</strong> (consume). The <strong>37...........</strong> (implement) of e-government could also promote better communications with the business sectors (B2G) with the aim to foster open and transparent market as well as a stronger economy. However, there are disadvantages, too. The principal one includes the <strong>38...........</strong> (absent) of public Internet access for all citizens.

            <h2>Sekcia 5: Čítanie s porozumením - "Scamming the Scammers"</h2>
            <div class="context-text reading-text">
                 <p>Tiffany Wilson is a scambaiter; that is, she spends her free time communicating with scammers in order to catch them out. Here she tells her story:</p>
                 <p>'I first got into scambaiting when my grandmother got tempted into adopting a puppy. She saw some pictures of cute puppies on social media, along with a text saying that they would be killed unless someone adopts them. Fortunately, I warned her before it was too late. Scammers first attract people with bargain prices, so she didn't lose much...'</p>
                 <p>'I was already familiar with the puppy scam then. We learnt about scamming during internet safety classes at school, though I heard about the puppy scam elsewhere. It was mentioned in an online video about the different ways scammers get money out of people. I think my generation knows much more about scamming than older people. People my age who see loads of scambaiting videos have a much better idea of how common scamming is and the tactics that are used...'</p>
                 <p>'Scambaiting involves engaging scammers in conversation. When they ask you to do something, you act a little stupid by asking lots of questions or making mistakes. It's frustrating for them, but they stay on the line patiently because they think they will get money out of you. I don't think you can be a scambaiter unless you are pretty sociable, as you have to talk to people for a long time. Most scambaiters put videos of their calls online, and the popular ones are very funny...'</p>
                 <p>'I scambait first and foremost because I want to help people recognise scams, and although most viewers of my videos are young, I'm sure the content they learn passes on to other family members. It'd be nice if I actually helped to get a scammer arrested, but there are just too many scammers for police to deal with. But as long as I am wasting a scammer's time, that person can't be scamming someone else. I also get a bit of income from the adverts that go out on my videos...'</p>
                 <p>'The most popular of my videos are the ones that make the scammers look foolish, and I'm forever deleting racist comments. I know that a lot of scammers are really poor. They believe that all Westerners are rich and that scamming them does little harm. I've tried to convince scammers to get a more responsible job, but I haven't had any luck yet, as they have few employment opportunities. But I hope the conversations I have with them go some way in helping people understand the lives of people in poor countries and the things they have to do for cash.'</p>

                <p>There is a new business culture now spread world-wide and its name is quiet quitting. This phenomenon is defined as a process when an employee comes to work only to complete the minimum <strong>46...........</strong> as stated in the contract. No-one works overtime or steps outside the agreed <strong>47...........</strong> . Extra work (often unpaid before) is considered as unreasonable <strong>48...........</strong> now; people reassess their <strong>49...........</strong> towards work. So do the bosses. They respond with quiet <strong>50...........</strong> forcing their employees to leave e.g. by not giving them enough respect or a pay rise. A LinkedIn poll proves it: In their survey 48% of employees questioned have already met with this practice in their workplaces.</p>
